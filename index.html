                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to developing a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists of
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top known as a
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and the second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>The second project is that I developed a processor using vhdl. This processor was able to perform
                    MIPS instruction using a pipeline design.
